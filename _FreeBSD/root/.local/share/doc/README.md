This is the user-specific directory housing user supplied, non-critical,
user-specific document files (e.g. man pages) for extending the operating
system (OS)'s functionalities from *Complete* stage to *Personalized* stage.
This means that font files in this directory only appears specifically for this
user.

Depending on the operating system's engineering specification, this directory
can be **ENTIRELY OPTIONAL**.

**Only `root` and administrators (users with `wheel` permission) can access the
directory**.

Programs **SHOULD NOT** assume any file or directory and always perform safe
query before use.

Generally, unless absolute necessary, you **SHOULD NOT** place anything here
**UNLESS** you are the OS distributor. This is to avoid any conflict with the
upstream's registries that will break the OS in any way. Use `/home/[USERNAME]`
instead.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

It is a practice to house the files using `trademark` and `product`
sub-directories pattern. This can significantly reduces the naming collision for
common names.

Here are the examples:

```
/root/.local/share/doc/
  trademark/
    product1/
      program.pdf
      program.txt
      program.1
      ...
    product2/
      program.pdf
      program.txt
      program.1
      ...
    ...

# OR

/root/.local/share/doc/
  product1/
    program.pdf
    program.txt
    program.1
    ...
  product2/
    program.pdf
    program.txt
    program.1
    ...
  ...
```
