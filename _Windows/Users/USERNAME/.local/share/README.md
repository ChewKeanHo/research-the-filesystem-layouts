# `[DRIVE]/Users/[USERNAME]/.local/share`

This is the base directory for housing a single user's user-specific, user
supplied, non-critical CPU architecture independent data files (e.g images,
text, PDFs, audio, manuals) of an operating system (OS) to function properly.
This means it can operate in `Multi-User` mode in BSD realm or `Full Mode` in
Linux realm.

The goal is to expand the OS' functionalities from *Complete* stage to
*Personalized* stage achieving full per-user customization capabilities. All
payloads, filepaths, configurations, data, etc. are specific to this runtime
hardware and to the owning user.

Due to its processing nature, one **MUST** carefully work here to prevent any
data poisoning or losses.

Programs **SHOULD NOT** assume any file and directory here and **SHOULD** always
practice safe-querying before use.

All files here are available to the owning user, `root` account, and OS
administrators (users with `wheel` permission) for create, read, update, and
delete operation.

In some `Linux`-based OSs notably SystemD-based, Red Hat, and Fedora; this
directory is heavily used as they shifted user-oriented dedicated software like
flatpak package manager (e.g. `$ flatpak --user install`) for achieving rootless
operation.

In Apple `MacOS`, this directory is facilitated mainly for supporting BSD
inter-compatibilities purposes only. `MacOS` does not not really use and depend
on it. Also this directory is part of the `local domain`.

In Microsoft `Windows`, this directory is inter-compatible with other UNIX and
UNIX-like OSes for localized software package management.

Generally, you **SHOULD** place your files here. All of them are only available
specifically for you.




## Naming Conventions

[![banner](/.internals/trademarks/banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

There are 2 systems in this directory organizations:

* functional directories (e.g. `fonts`, `doc`, `man`).
* non-functional directories.

Before designating where to place the files, one **MUST** check the functional
directory's availability before implementing the latter pattern.

It is a practice to house the files using `trademark` and `product`
sub-directories pattern for both of them. This can significantly reduces the
naming collision for common names. Deploy them accordingly for all the
directory organizations above.

Here are the examples:
